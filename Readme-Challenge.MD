## **Description**

## QA Challenge
 The goal of this challenge is to successfully execute all the testing steps on the given websites, starting from QA planning, all the way to reporting.
Assignment

You will perform two QA exercises to evaluate your manual testing and automatization skills. You will need to:
● Do QA planning.
● Create test cases based on the requirements.
● Find bugs on a website and report them on a bug tracking system.
● Set up an automated test suite
● Deliver a test run report document where test case pass and fails can be reviewed
Mandatory Features
● Deliver a detailed planning sheet for each exercise.
● Design good test cases.
● Find as many bugs as possible on each website.
● Keep track of the bug life cycle with your Trello board.
● Show evidence of the bugs. Let us know how critical they are.
● Deliver a test run report and a bug report for each website.
● Deliver a good automation suite. Remember that it should be able to run on any computer. Your evaluator should not take hours guessing how to run it!
  
_Exercise 1_

The site ​http://zero.webappsecurity.com​ must meet the following requirements:

● Verify the main navigation is displayed in all the internal tabs of the site.

● Layout must adapt to mobile device screens.

● The Feedback contact form should validate inputs before sending a message.

Perform the following testing tasks:

● Execute smoke test for the above requirements.

● Create high level test cases for the Feedback section and execute them.

● Create a board on ​http://trello.com​, create lists for steps on bug resolution, and report

bugs.
Deliverables:
● Share a Google spreadsheet including the following information:
○ Test cases list
○ Test run report
● Share a trello board including the following information:
○ List structure for bug resolution
○ Bugs reported

_Exercise 2:_

The e-commerce site ​http://automationpractice.com​ is under development, and some of the features have to be tested. The website must meet the following requirements:

● The homepage should display the sections detailed on the design pdf file. It should display pixel-perfect on Chrome browser, viewport 1200px and above. The design file can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0aWI6NMr3VdWmo2Rm8tRGdjREU/view?usp=sharing

● Layout should be cross-browser compatible. Supported browsers are IE11, Chrome, Firefox and Safari on their latest versions (Pixel perfect applies only to Chrome.)

● For search, the user should be able to find all products containing the keyword in the
product title. Products not containing the keyword should not display on results.

● On Contact form, all fields must be validated before sending a message.
      
 ● Add to cart flow should allow the user to:
○ Add products from category sections and search results.
○ The cart in the header must reflect all products added by the user.
○ Ability to remove item from cart on the header.
○ Users should be presented with checkout form using Proceed to checkout link on
the header cart. Perform the following testing tasks:
● Execute pixel perfect test on home page.
● Create detailed test cases for the search section, add to cart functionality, and contact
form section.
● Execute acceptance test to the above sections based on test cases and requirements.
● Create a board on ​http://trello.com​, create lists for steps on bug resolution and report
bugs. Make sure that it is easy to find bugs for a specific functionality or requirement.
● Create an automation suite for contact form validation using a tool of your choosing (We
recommend the framework Selenium.) Deliverables:
● Share a Google spreadsheet including the following information: ○ Detailed test cases.
○ Test run report.
● Create a zip file including your automation suite.
○ Make sure to use well-known libraries, and specify the one you use on the readme. We suggest using Selenium, Robot Framework, Python or Java.
○ Specify what programs need to be installed, and what steps must be followed to run your automation suite.
● Share a trello board including the following information:
○ List structure for bug resolution.
○ Bugs reported.
